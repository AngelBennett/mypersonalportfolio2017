            <span>Okay, so it's actually about 12 or 13 lines so far. Obviously, I'm going to change this content but this will do for now. Hmmm... Well, here's a quote from one of my favorite movies, "Raising Arizona": H.I.: [final lines] That night I had a dream. I dreamt I was as light as the ether- a floating
                spirit visiting things to come. The shades and shadows of the people in my life rassled their way
                their way into my slumber. I dreamed that Gale and Evelle had decided to return to prison. Probably
                that's just as well. I don't mean to sound superior, and they're a swell couple of guys, but maybe
                they weren't ready yet to come out into the world. And then I dreamed on, into the future, to a
                Christmas morn in the Arizona home where Nathan Junior was opening a present from a kindly couple
                who preferred to remain unknown. I saw Glen a few years later, still having no luck getting the cops
                to listen to his wild tales about me and Ed. Maybe he threw in one Polack joke too many. I don't know.
                And still I dreamed on, further into the future than I had ever dreamed before, watching Nathan
                Junior's progress from afar, taking pride in his accomplishments as if he were our own. Wondering
                if he ever thought of us and hoping that maybe we'd broadened his horizons a little even if he
                couldn't remember just how they got broadened. But still I hadn't dreamt nothing about me and Ed
                until the end. And this was cloudier cause it was years, years away. But I saw an old couple being
                visited by their children, and all their grandchildren too. The old couple weren't screwed up. And
                neither were their kids or their grandkids. And I don't know. You tell me. This whole dream, was it
                wishful thinking? Was I just fleeing reality like I know I'm liable to do? But me and Ed, we can be
                good too. And it seemed real. It seemed like us and it seemed like, well, our home. If not Arizona,
                then a land not too far away. Where all parents are strong and wise and capable and all children are
                happy and beloved. I don't know. Maybe it was Utah. LOL, I have 8 by the way!
